## Hate Speech Detection: creation of a dictionary of the bully language
The aim of this research is to create a dictionary of the bully language
so as to be able to distinguish offensive/abusive tweets from non-offensive ones, in order
to suggest a possible solution to the propagation of the hate on the social media. 
In order to perform this task, the research exploits the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations(LIME), a Phyton library that explains how the classifiers perform on data, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), an unsupervised method based on topic modeling.

## Keywords
hate speech, classification, supervised learning, LIME, unsupervised learning, LDA, dictionary.
